# Become The Joris (WIP)

![Mod Preview](/About/Preview.png)


Become The Joris
A race created by a mad scientist and sent back to the beginning of time, they became the gods, they became the people.

This is a mod made using Humanoid Alien Races 2.0 and my sanity. This makes Jorisfolk playable and with their abilities.
